![(Raging Midi's main screen)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ragingmidi/screenshots/Screen0.png "Raging Midi's main screen")

Goal of the project: make a complete open-source replacement of Anvil Studio.
Current status: GUI-based MIDI reader/writer/player for Windows/Linux.

## Getting started
To build Raging MIDI, you need the [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) and OpenGL libraries.

You might want to read the source code documentation, which for now you can get by installing [ROBODoc](http://robodoc.sourceforge.net/) and running `robodoc --rc robodoc.rc` in the root repository directory.
